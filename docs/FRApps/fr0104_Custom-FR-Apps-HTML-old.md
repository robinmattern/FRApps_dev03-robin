#### Introduction <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->  
- The following steps use the repo: FRApps_dev. Customization of your web apps will be done here. You will create an FRApps_dev repo in your pewrsonal github account. You will be able to Push and Pull as you develop your apps.

- Your first customization will be done using only html, css and javascript. 

#### Important note about names, capitalization, pictures and code copying <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->
- In this tutorial please be careful to use the Exact Spelling and Capitalization. You will be using Windows, Unix and GitBash command prompts. Improper captialization will cause commands to fail. Some examples are: Local_Admin, myProject, repos, remotes and .ssh.
- This documentation was produced in 2021-2022. You will experience differences in some of the pictures due to the changes made over time by the developers of the softwares and web sites that are used.
- We recommend that you cut and paste code snippets from the Documentation into your workstation/server. This will reduce the errors caused by hand typing.
